## 1. Objective
Detection and identification of electronic components in Power Supply Units (PSUs) for PCs.
The result at a first stage should provide identification of major components as ilustrated in the image bellow:

#### PSU: Corsair SF600 Platinum / Photo source: jonnyGURU.com

Detection of defects will be adresses later.

## 2. Motivation
My passion for PC hardware and deep learning and the desire to combine both to build a computer vision project.

PSUs were choosen because thery are common, their core components are well known and there are a considerable number of reviews that provide a great number of quality photos and information on their electronics. This makes them a good source of information to build a labeled dataset for electronics, to compensate the lack of open source options.

### Side note:
A PSU is a very important componet in a PC, besides its main task to convert AC current do DC current, if of good quality it helps in the PC performance, provides currenct protection and prolongs the life of all other PC components.
